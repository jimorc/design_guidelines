# Design Guidelines

**A set of coding and design guidelines that I use on my projects. They form a good base for guidelines that
you can modify and use on your own projects.**

## Getting Started

### Installation

* There are no installation instructions. You can, if you wish, clone this project for your own use. As there is
no executable code in this repository, there are otherwise no need for installation instructions.

### Guides

The coding guidelines and the design guidelines are placed into separate directories. The place to start is the
READM.md file. There are links from there to the various guidelines.

## Contributing

The [authors file](https://github.com/jimorc/design_guidelines/blob/main/AUTHORS.md) lists contributors together with contact information. If you make a contribution, please add yourself to the list.

**Your contributions are welcome.**

There are many areas in which these guidelines can be improved, either through better wording, or through the addition
of more guidelines. There are many guidelines in the 
[C++ Core Guidelines](https://github.com/isocpp/CppCoreGuidelines/blob/master/CppCoreGuidelines.md)
that are not including in the guidelines that I have provided in this project. If you wish to contribute:

* First read [Code of conduct](https://github.com/jimorc/design_guidelines/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
to make sure your contribution follows the rules.
* [Fork](https://github.com/jimorc/design_guidelines/fork) the project and use a pull request for adding your contribution.
* If you face any problems feel free to open an issue at the 
[issues tracker](https://github.com/jimorc/design_guidelines/issues), 
If you feel like there is a missing feature, please raise a ticket on Github. Pull requests are also welcome.

**Your feedback is important for the evolution of the project.**

## Beginners
