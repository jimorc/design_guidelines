# Design Guidelines
This document and its subdocuments provide design guidelines that I follow in my C++ projects starting in 2022. 
The goal is to
help contributors ensure API consistency, ease of use, and ease of reading the source code by providing a unified
programming model for development. I recommend that you follow these design guidelines when modifying the code
in my repositories, and when submitting new functionality to them. Inconsistent application and framework
design adversely affects developer productivity and discourages adoption.

There is some overlap with my coding guidelines as should be expected since there is no sharp division possible
between the two. So be sure to see the coding guidelines as well. A link to them is provided below.

The guidelines are organized as simple recommendations prefixed with the terms **‚úì Do**, **ü§î Consider**, **‚ùå Avoid**, 
and  **‚ùå Do not**. 
However, they must be followed for any additions or modifications to the projects that specify these guidelines.
