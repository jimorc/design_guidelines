# Naming Guidelines

Following a consistent set of naming conventions in the development of a library can be a major contribution to the
library's usability. It allows the library to be used by many developers on widely separate projects. Beyond consistency
 of form, names must be easily understood and must convey to function of each element.

The goal of this chapter is to provide a consistent set of naming conventions that results in names that make immediate
sense to the library developers and users of the library.
