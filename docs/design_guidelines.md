# Design Guidelines
This document and its subdocuments provide guidelines for coding additions to the libjxtd repository. The goal is to
 help contributors ensure API consistency, ease of use, and ease of reading the source code by providing a unified
 programming model for development. We recommend that you follow these design guidelines when modifying the code
 in this repository, and when submitting new functionality to it. Inconsistent library design adversely affects
 developer productivity and discourages adoption.

 The guidelines are organizes as simple recommendations prefixed with the terms *Do*, *Consider*, *Avoid*, and *Do not*.
