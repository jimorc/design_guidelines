# Naming Guidelines

Following a consistent set of naming conventions in the development of a framework can be a major contribution to the
framework's usability. It allows the framework to be used by many developers on widely separate projects. Beyond 
consistency of form, names must be easily understood and must convey the function of each element.

Similarly, consistent naming conventions in the development of an application can make the efforts of later developers
and maintainers easier.

The goal of this chapter is to provide a consistent set of naming conventions that results in names that make immediate
sense to the developers and users of the framework and to the developers of the application.
