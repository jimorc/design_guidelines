# Coding Guidelines

Coding guidelines specify how the code should look. This includes, for example, where braces should be placed, where
and when space characters should be placed in the source code, and naming conventions. Coding guidelines vary greatly
from one project or repository to another. 

The guidelines specified here are for projects that I have started in 2022 and beyond. If you are contributing to any
of my projects, I request that you follow both the coding and design guidelines. This will ensure that future
developers and users are presented with a consistent look to the code thus allowing them to read and understand the
code more easily.
 
Coding guidelines differ from design guidelines which specify how the code should be organized. For example, design
guidelines specify how to design for extensibility, how to use exceptions, design patterns to use and when, and so forth.
You will find some overlap between the two sets of guidelines because it is difficult at times to separate them. You will
also find links provided between the two where appropriate.

The guidelines are organized as simple recommendations prefixed with the terms **‚úìDo**, **ü§î Consider**, **‚ùå Avoid**, 
and  **‚ùå Do not**. 
However, they must be followed for any addition or modifications to the projects that specify these guidelines.Here are the coding guidelines for my projects.
